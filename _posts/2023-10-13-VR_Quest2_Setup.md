# VR - Quest2 / OpenXR setup in Godot

The purpose of the blog is to document my journey in becoming a (XR) game developer using the Godot engine.
I created this infographic as a reference when setting up a new VR Project in Godot.

Here are links to useful manuals and documentation for more detailed information:

- [OpenXR Reference guide](https://www.khronos.org/files/openxr-10-reference-guide.pdf)
- [Godot XR](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/xr/setting_up_xr.html)
